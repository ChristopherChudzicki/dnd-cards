# Card overflow pagination

## Problem

When an item card's body is longer than fits a single physical card, the text is silently clipped. `AutoFitCard` already steps the font down (1.0 → 0.9 → 0.8), but past that the body's `overflow: hidden` truncates without warning. Users have no signal that content was lost.

## Goal

Render an oversized item as a sequence of physical cards with a clear continuation marker, so the full body always reaches the printed sheet.

## UX summary

- An item whose body overflows after the existing scale-down splits into multiple physical cards.
- The split is greedy at word boundaries: each card is filled before starting the next. Mid-paragraph and mid-sentence breaks are allowed; mid-word breaks are not (with one fallback — see edge cases).
- Continuation cards differ from the first card in two ways:
  - Title shows `Item Name (p2 of 4)` (and `(p1 of 4)` on the first card when there is more than one).
  - The italic type line below the title is hidden.
- Image/icon (top-right) and footer (cost/weight) appear on every physical card.
- Once an item is split, the body renders at the natural 1.0 scale — `AutoFitCard`'s scale-down is only used when an item still fits on a single card.

## Architecture (Approach A: centralized pagination)

```
ItemCard[]
  └─ useExpandedCards(items, layout)
       │   measures each body in a hidden DOM container, splits as needed
       └─→ physicalCards: Array<{
             card: ItemCard;
             bodyChunk: string;
             pagination?: { page, total };
             needsScaleFit: boolean;       // single-card item; render via AutoFitCard
           }>
            │
            └─ chunk(perPage) → pages → render
```

### `Card.tsx`

Adds two optional props:

```ts
type Props = {
  card: ItemCard;
  layout: CardLayout;
  pagination?: { page: number; total: number };
  bodyOverride?: string;
};
```

Inside the component, derive `const isFirstPage = !pagination || pagination.page === 1;` and gate first-page-only content off it. For now that's just the type line; future first-only rows use the same gate.

When `pagination` is set, the title is rendered as `${card.name} (p${page} of ${total})`. The body uses `bodyOverride ?? card.body`.

When `pagination` is undefined and `bodyOverride` is undefined, the component behaves exactly as today.

### `AutoFitCard.tsx`

Unchanged. Continues to handle 1.0 / 0.9 / 0.8 scale-down for single-card items.

### `src/cards/paginate.ts` (new)

```ts
export type PaginateMeasurer = (prefix: string) => boolean;
// returns true iff `prefix` fits the body at the configured layout/page-shape

export function paginateBody(opts: {
  body: string;
  measureFirst: PaginateMeasurer;       // first card: includes type line
  measureContinuation: PaginateMeasurer; // page 2+: no type line
}): string[];
// returns one chunk per physical card; length 1 if the whole body fits
```

The two measurers reflect that the first card has a type line eating header space while continuations do not — so continuations have a slightly larger body budget. Both are injected callbacks so the function stays pure and unit-testable without a DOM.

**Algorithm:**

1. If `measureFirst(body)` is true, return `[body]` (single card, no pagination).
2. Otherwise, binary-search the largest word-prefix `P1` such that `measureFirst(P1)` is true. Append `P1` to the output and trim it (plus leading whitespace) off the front of `body`.
3. While `body` is non-empty:
   - If `measureContinuation(body)` is true, append `body` and stop.
   - Else binary-search the largest word-prefix `Pn` such that `measureContinuation(Pn)` is true; append it and advance.
4. **Single-token-too-long fallback**: if a binary search returns 0 words (one token longer than a card body — rare, e.g., a URL), fall back to character-boundary search for that one chunk only.

Word tokenization preserves intervening whitespace so paragraph breaks (`\n\n`) survive a mid-paragraph split correctly when the chunk is rejoined.

### `useExpandedCards(items, layout)` (new, in `src/cards/`)

A hook that:

1. Lazily mounts two hidden full `<Card>` instances per layout off-screen (`position: absolute; left: -10000px;`): one shaped like a first card (with type line, with a sentinel `(p9 of 9)` pagination suffix on the title), one shaped like a continuation (no type line, same sentinel). Rendering full cards rather than synthetic body boxes ensures real header/divider/footer sizing — including title wrapping — drives the body's measured height. The sentinel is a worst-case proxy for the actual suffix; minor real-suffix differences are accepted as a known approximation.
2. For each item, calls `paginateBody({ body, measureFirst, measureContinuation })` where each `measure(prefix)` swaps the candidate body into the corresponding measurer Card and returns `bodyEl.scrollHeight <= bodyEl.clientHeight`.
3. Memoizes by `(body, layout)` — the only inputs that affect splits.
4. Returns `{ physicalCards, isMeasuring }`.

The two measurers are reused across calls. They're removed on unmount of the last consumer (ref-counted module-level cleanup).

The hook also supports `useExpandedCards([singleCard], layout)` for the editor preview's per-keystroke recomputation.

### `PrintView.tsx`

```tsx
const items = cards.filter(...).filter(c => c.kind === "item");
const { physicalCards } = useExpandedCards(items, layout);
const pages = chunk(physicalCards, perPage);
```

Each slot picks `<AutoFitCard>` when `entry.needsScaleFit` is true, else `<Card>` directly with `bodyOverride` and `pagination` from the entry.

### `EditorView.tsx`

The right-hand preview pane gets:

- A counts label that always renders, derived by running `paginateBody` once per layout for the current draft:
  - `1 card` when both 4-up and 2-up produce a single chunk.
  - `3 cards (4-up) · 2 cards (2-up)` when they differ or either is >1.
- The preview itself stays at 4-up size, showing one card at a time. When the 4-up split has more than one chunk, a paginator (`← Page 2 of 3 →`) appears below the preview. The visible-page index is local `useState`, clamped if the chunk count shrinks while typing.
- The preview renders `<AutoFitCard>` when there's only one chunk, `<Card>` with `bodyOverride` + `pagination` when there are multiple.

## Edge cases

- **Single token longer than one card** — character-boundary fallback for that one chunk only (see paginate.ts step 4).
- **Empty body** — `paginateBody` returns `[""]`; one card, no pagination metadata.
- **Body unchanged across re-renders** — memoization key prevents re-measure.
- **Image fails on continuation** — each `Card` instance owns its own `brokenUrl` state; per-page fallback is fine.
- **Body shrinks while editing** — `useExpandedCards` recomputes; the editor's local page index is clamped to the new chunk count.

## Testing

Hybrid: keep Vitest + JSDOM for the bulk of the work, add Playwright for things that genuinely need a browser.

### Vitest (existing runner)

- `paginate.test.ts` — pure algorithm with a fake `measure` that resolves based on configured "fits up to N characters" rules. Covers: no-split when body fits, exact word-boundary splits, multi-page splits, single-long-token character fallback, empty body.
- `Card.test.tsx` — additions for the `pagination` prop: title suffix appears, type line is hidden when `page > 1` (and `page === 1` of >1 total), footer still renders, `bodyOverride` is used.
- `useExpandedCards.test.ts` — hook behavior with the measurer DOM stubbed via `Object.defineProperty(HTMLElement.prototype, "scrollHeight", …)` (same pattern as the existing `AutoFitCard.test.tsx`). Verifies memoization keys and the `needsScaleFit` flag.

### Playwright (new — `e2e/` directory)

Two focused specs against the dev server:

1. `e2e/editor-pagination.spec.ts` — type a long body into the item editor; assert the counts label updates (`"3 cards (4-up) · …"`), the paginator appears, prev/next moves the visible page, the `(p2 of 3)` suffix appears in the preview title.
2. `e2e/print-pagination.spec.ts` — seed a deck with one long item, navigate to `/print`, set `perPage=4`, assert the sheet contains the expected number of `[data-role="card-root"]` with sequential `(p1 of N)`…`(pN of N)` titles, image/footer present on each, type line absent on continuations.

Playwright is added under `devDependencies` (this requires user approval per project convention). CI gets a new job; locally the e2e suite is a separate npm script.

### Out of scope

- Visual-regression snapshots of printed sheets (could be a follow-up).
- Manual page breaks (no UI for the user to insert one).
- Pagination for non-item card kinds (spell, ability) — they're not rendered by `Card.tsx` today.

## Risks

- **Measurement performance on the editor's per-keystroke recompute.** Mitigated by memoization on `(body, layout)`. Worst case is one binary search per layout per change — O(log n) measurer mounts per keystroke. Should be fine for hundreds-of-words bodies; revisit if profiling shows hitches.
- **Measurer drift from real card.** The hidden measurers render real `<Card>` instances, so they pick up CSS changes automatically. The remaining approximation is the sentinel pagination suffix (`(p9 of 9)`) — close enough in practice; the e2e tests catch any real misbehavior.
- **Adding Playwright is a non-trivial dependency change.** Browsers in CI, install time, and a new test runner. Worth it given the printed-output stakes; user must approve the dependency add before the implementation runs `npm install`.
