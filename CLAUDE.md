# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific guidance for AI coding sessions on this repo. Read alongside `README.md`.

## Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, TanStack Router + TanStack Query.
- `@supabase/supabase-js` for auth + persistence; no other backend code.
- Biome for lint + format. CSS modules for styling.
- Vitest + RTL + `@testing-library/user-event`. MSW for HTTP mocks. Fishery + faker for factories.

## Design system

See README's "Design system" section for the full picture. Short version:

- **Screen tokens** live in `src/index.css` (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, etc.). All screen UI references them; no inline hexes/rems in scope.
- **Print-scoped tokens** are namespaced `--print-*` and used only by printable card components (`Card`, `AutoFitCard`, `PrintView`). They never apply to screen UI.
- Use `react-aria-components` for new interactive primitives. **No** emotion / styled-components / MUI / Tailwind / shadcn.
- Shared UI primitives live in `src/lib/ui/`. Prefer reusing them over hand-rolling new patterns.
- The card preview shown in the editor renders the same `<Card>` (or `<AutoFitCard>`) component as `PrintView`, so screen preview matches print output exactly.

## Tests

- Prefer `getByRole(...)` over text/class selectors. React Aria primitives expose accurate ARIA roles.
- Factories pass no values they don't assert on. Don't write `factory.build({ name: "Foo" })` unless the test reads `name`.
- Tests sit next to the file they cover (`Foo.tsx` + `Foo.test.tsx`).

## Code

- Default to no comments. Add one only when the WHY is non-obvious (a hidden constraint, a workaround, behavior that would surprise a reader).
- Don't add features, refactors, or abstractions beyond what the task requires.
- Don't add error handling for cases that can't happen — trust internal code.
- Biome's formatter is authoritative — if it reformats your output, accept the reformatting.

## Working norms

- `npm test`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run build` are pre-approved — run them as needed. Ask before `npm install` (or other dependency changes).
- Address review nits inline in the same task — don't accumulate a deferred cleanup pass.
- Don't use `git -C <path>` — run git from the working directory.
- Don't push or create PRs without explicit instruction.

## Off-limits without asking

- **Print-scoped components**: `src/cards/Card.tsx`, `src/cards/AutoFitCard.tsx`, `src/views/PrintView.tsx`, and `@page` rules. These target print dimensions in absolute units; changes risk breaking 4-per-sheet output.
- `src/cards/ItemEditor.tsx` is **not** off-limits — it's a screen form that uses the design system like any other view.
- Database schema and RLS policies — changes go through `supabase/migrations`.
